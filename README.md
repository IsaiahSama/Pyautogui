# Repository for my projects created using Pyautogui.

## Classes.py:

This is my personal bot to join my google classes. Currently working on a fully customizable one for general use. You can check it's progress as I work on it [here](https://github.com/IsaiahSama/classmeet)
**Requires gmeetclass folder to be in the same directory**

## Click.py

This is a function using win32api that donttap.py and whackamole.py use to click. However it does not need to be downloaded as I also have it in the individual files soooo... Just for reference I guess...

## Donttap.py

This is a bot created to play [don't tap the white tiles](http://www.donttap.com/). Since I used co-ordinates you may have to change the coordinates the bot looks at. I have the file commented out to make for easy changing. When I coded this, my browser was on half size on the left side of my screen (click and drag the top of your browser all the way to the left). As screen sizes differ, the co-ordinates specified may or may not work.

## meetjoiner.py

A bot used to join a google meeting and send messages that you specify in 20 second intervals cause... why not.
**Requires gmeetclass folder to be in the same directory**

## Whackamole.py

A bot created to play [whack a mole](https://www.memory-improvement-tips.com/whack-a-mole-game-window.html). As with donttap.py, the co-ordinates were set up specifically for my screen. When I coded this, my browser was on half size on the left side of my screen (click and drag the top of your browser all the way to the left). As screen sizes differ, the co-ordinates specified may or may not work. Check the file itself for more information.
